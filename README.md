# News-Classification-using-Random-Forest-Classifier
This project classifies news articles into different categories (e.g., politics, sports, business, technology, entertainment) using the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble machine learning algorithm.
# The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles (such as headlines or full content), where each article belongs to a specific category. By analyzing text features, the classifier learns to predict the correct category of unseen news articles.

The main objectives of this project are:

To preprocess and clean raw news text.

To apply text vectorization (Bag of Words / TF-IDF).

To train a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

To evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
